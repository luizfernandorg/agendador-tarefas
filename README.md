### README In production

## Installation

To install this project, follow the steps below. Before starting the service, make sure the PostgreSQL database named db_usuario has been created. 
This service does not include a frontend page; it's a Java backend only. Therefore, using Postman is recommended for testing.

```bash
  git clone (https://github.com/luizfernandorg/agendador-tarefas.git)
  cd usuario
  ./gradlew clean build; ./gradlew bootRun
```
